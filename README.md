Product Back-order Prediction for Efficient Inventory Control

Prediction of backorders of products boosts up companies’ revenues in many ways. In this work, the backorder of products is predicted 
using two machine learning models named Distributed Random Forest (DRF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) in H2O platform, and the 
performances of them are compared. We have observed that GBM successfully identified approximately 94 products out of every 100 products 
that go to backorder. We have noticed that the current stock level and the lead time of products act as the deciding factors of products’ 
backorder in approximately 45% of the cases. We have shown how this model can be used to predict the probable backorder products before 
actual backorder can happen and how to visualize the impacts on inventory management. Based on the results of this paper, the decision 
threshold below 0.3 for high probable backorder products, and the threshold between 0.2 to 0.8 for low probable backorder products maximize
organizational profit. The mentioned methods in this paper can be utilized in other supply chain cases to forecast backorders.
